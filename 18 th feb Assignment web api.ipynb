    "    REST is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications.\n",
    "    When a request for data is sent to a REST API, itâ€™s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language (despite the name), is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight. In this way, RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.\n",
    "    REST follows client server architecture and it is stateless and cacheable.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SOAP is a standard protocol that was first designed so that applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate. Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times. However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions.\n",
    "    SOAP architecture is based on XML. Xml is a markup language\n",
    "    or file system. Internally XML uses WSDL(Web Service description language)\n",
    "    SOAP support HTTP, SMTP, TCP protocols.It is more secure than rest architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcoming of SOAP\n",
    "    \n",
    "   1.SOAP uses XML format that must be parsed to be read. It defines many standards that must be followed while developing the SOAP applications. So it is slow and consumes more bandwidth and resource.\n",
    "   2. SOAP uses WSDL and doesn't have any other mechanism to discover the service.\n",
